# Spacetimers

Once upon a time, I needed to run a bunch of timers for a D&D game I DM in which 'real-time' events were going to happen to the players.  I ended up fiddling with phones and it sort of caused me a lot of stress. 

Since I couldn't quickly find the kind of web app that I needed, I spent a few hours over the weekend building what I need. It's free to use, runs 100% in browser, has a lot of customization options. 

I will not be taking any feature requests or bug fixes.  

## Usage

Either type in the `M` and `S` fields (Minutes and Seconds) or use the arrow buttons to change the value.

Click ▶ to start a countdown. Click ⏸ to pause a countdown. Click ↺ (only when paused) to reset the timer back to the previously set values.  

You can change the name of the timer by clicking on the field that says `Timer 1` initially.  An uncreative default name will be assigned to each new timer. 

A sound will play when the timer hits 0.  Click ⚙ to disable the sound playing.  In this menu you can also change the colors of the timer, Delete the timer, or make it auto reset at the end of the run.
