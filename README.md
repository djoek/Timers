# Spacetimers

Once upon a time, I needed to run a bunch of timers for a D&D game I DM in which 'real-time' events were going to happen to the players.  I ended up fiddling with phones and it sort of caused me a lot of stress. 

Since I couldn't quickly find the kind of web app that I needed, I spent a few hours over the weekend building what I need. It's free to use, runs 100% in browser, has a lot of customization options. 

I will not be taking any feature requests or bug fixes.
